            <h3>Buy stocks at discounts to where the Wall Street billionaires bought them!</h3>
            <p>Any big investor has to file every quarter what they own. With a simple formula we estimate what they paid for their holdings. If the current price for a stock is lower than what the investor paid for it, you can find it above. The formula to estimate what the hedge funds paid for a stock is the average price from the past quarter.</p>
            <p>Example:
                Warren Buffett buys a stock at an estimated value of $80 and it goes down to $40. We find that stock and list if for you. Now if you buy that stock at $40 you’ll get a 50 % discount to what Warren paid. You’re safe to assume that he had the stock thoroughly analysed and solid reason to buy it at $80. It’s like the greatest investor of all time works for you!</p>
            <h3>Be a smart investor – don’t pay for advice!</h3>
            <p>There are a lot of different strategies on the Internet on how to become just as successful as the biggest trading institutions in the world. Often you can get access to these strategies for a fee ranging between a few of dollars a month to several hundred dollars a month. But then again it makes no sense to pay 100 bucks a month for a trading strategy that’s supposedly already made the one selling it ten million dollars or more. What’s he going to do with an extra hundred dollars? The truth is he probably doesn’t have a good trading strategy to begin with and he’s only selling rubbish advice.</p>
